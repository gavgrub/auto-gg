# auto-gg
A number of programs I've written to automatically generate applications for University of Calgary clubs. Called "auto-gg" as it automatically does all the work Gavin Grubert was hired to do.
## Installation
Navigate to powershell and run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gavgrub/auto-gg.git
cd auto-gg
```
Some of the scripts within this repository require a Groq api key, which can be generated for free by creating an account on [their website](https://groq.com/). You can enter it in a .env file in the main directory as follows:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=...
```
To confirm it is working correctly, you can run the following in the main directory:
```
python helper/ai.py
```
## Generating SELF Applications
To generate a SELF application, first fill out data.json with relevant information related to the event. Following this, navigate to powershell in the main directory and run the following:
```bash
python self.py
```
Afterwards, the file "{activityName} SELF Application.docx" will be generated, appearing in the running directory. Be sure to check over the paragraphs within the application, as they are generated by a LLM, which can make mistakes.
